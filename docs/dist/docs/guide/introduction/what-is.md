## Simplify Your Protobuf Development

EasyP accelerates development, ensures consistency across your protobuf files, and provides a convenient mechanism for
managing protobuf packages.
By automating tedious tasks and catching potential errors, EasyP reduces the risk of production breaks and ensures a
smoother development experience.

## Decentralized Package Management

Unlike other tools, EasyP doesn't rely on a centralized server for package distribution.
Instead, any Git repository can serve as a package source, giving you more flexibility and control over your
dependencies.
This approach eliminates vendor lock-in and makes it easier to manage your protobuf packages.

## Seamless Migration from Buf

EasyP is fully backward compatible with Buf settings, ensuring a smooth transition from Buf to EasyP.
You can easily switch to EasyP without worrying about compatibility issues or reconfiguring your setup.
